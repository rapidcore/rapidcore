# RapidCore

Library with classes for the stuff you would otherwise build in every single project.

We target `NetStandard1.6` to include as many .NET runtimes as possible, while still having access to as many features as possible (see [Microsoft's version matrix](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md)).

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/), which means you can depend on RapidCore version `<major>.*`

It also means that while the major version is `0`, the APIs should be considered unstable.

## Issues

Issues should be reported in https://github.com/rapidcore/issues/issues
