# Traversing an object instance

Traversing an instance of an object is useful in many reflection based tasks, but it has a bunch of pitfalls and requires a seemingly infinite amount of tests.

Instead of repeating a bunch of these things every time we build something with reflection, we now have `RapidCore.Reflection.InstanceTraverser`, which can traverse an instance of an object.

It will:

- find all members (constructors, fields, properties and methods regardless of access level) of the instance and tell you about them through an `IInstanceListener` ([StateChangeFinder](../../Diffing/Diffing) does this)
- not do anything with what it finds except tell you about it
- follow complex values (i.e. recurse into other instances held by the members)
- notify you if it hits the given maximum depth during recursion
- traverse elements in enumerables, including recursing complex values
- traverse dictionaries, including recursing complex values
- ignore backing fields and methods generated by the compiler for auto properties
