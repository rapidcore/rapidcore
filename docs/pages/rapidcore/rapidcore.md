Library with classes for the stuff you would otherwise build in every single project.

We target `NetStandard1.6` to include as many .NET runtimes as possible, while still having access to as many features as possible (see [Microsoft's version matrix](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md)).

--------
Install the package

Install the package available from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rapid.Core).
For example, for .NET Core:
```
dotnet add package RapidCore
```
